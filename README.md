Spoot Creation
CIDS - 162


## Description

This is a project that contains a class with a constructor and method to create a 
"Spoot" object and provide the user with the details that apply to each of the objects.

When the project is loaded up information will be displayed relating to the creation of a
Spoot. It will provide the name, weight, age, color and ability that each of the objects
"Spoots" hold.

A setter method will be used which takes input from the user to change the
name of the Spoot and then a getter method can be used to verify that the name provided has updated
properly and maintains its new description.
